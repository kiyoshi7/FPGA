-- VHDL Test Bench Created from source file Main.vhd -- Sat Mar 02 17:04:07 2019

--
-- Notes: 
-- 1) This testbench template has been automatically generated using types
-- std_logic and std_logic_vector for the ports of the unit under test.
-- Lattice recommends that these types always be used for the top-level
-- I/O of a design in order to guarantee that the testbench will bind
-- correctly to the timing (post-route) simulation model.
-- 2) To use this template as your testbench, change the filename to any
-- name of your choice with the extension .vhd, and use the "source->import"
-- menu in the ispLEVER Project Navigator to import the testbench.
-- Then edit the user defined section below, adding code to generate the 
-- stimulus for your design.
-- 3) VHDL simulations will produce errors if there are Lattice FPGA library 
-- elements in your design that require the instantiation of GSR, PUR, and
-- TSALL and they are not present in the testbench. For more information see
-- the How To section of online help.
